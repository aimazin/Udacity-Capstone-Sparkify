# Udacity-Capstone-Sparkify
my own extracurricular take on Sparkify Project


## Table of Contents

- Sparkify.ipynb
- mini_sparkify_event_data.zip

## Installations

install latest version of python version 3.8


## Project Motivation

I have always been interest in big data ever since the inception of the idea and because of some intrenchment in Python, then Spark and hence Pyspark Project was the way to go.


## File Description  

- Sparkify.ipynb: jupyter notebook containing python analysis of datasets
- mini_sparkify_event_data.zip: containing subset mini_sparkify_event_data.csv of big data approx. 0.5% of data

## Results

- successfully conpleting a Pysparks script

- upon evaluation of classifier model all test data was correctly predicted

## Issues

- did not have access to full dataset hence do not know how the model really faired

- I did not do it in the script but please be nice and close the spark session you are done
